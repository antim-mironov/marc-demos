This repo contains demos I've shown at various conferences.

## BuildProcess
Shows a simple client side Web Part for "classic" SharePoint pages. It simply displays the items in a Task list on the page, and demonstrates:
* Using AngularJS as the framework to provide a simple and quick UI
* Using webpack to combine the various components into a single bundle
* Using gulp to deploy to the Office 365 tenant
